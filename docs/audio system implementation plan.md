## Implementation Principles

Throughout this implementation, we'll adhere to the following principles:

1. **User-First Development**: Every technical decision will be evaluated based on its impact on content creator workflows.

2. **Incremental Integration**: We'll integrate components gradually, using feature flags to ensure stability.

3. **Error Resilience**: Each component will include robust error handling with graceful fallbacks.

4. **Performance Focus**: Audio components will be optimized for performance, with careful attention to bundle size and rendering efficiency.

5. **Cross-Feature Cohesion**: All audio features will work seamlessly with related non-audio features.

6. **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced audio features will be revealed contextually, reducing interface complexity.

7. **Consistent Experience**: Audio UI patterns will remain consistent across all integration points.

This implementation plan transforms our current feature-centric audio components into a seamlessly integrated "unicorn" user experience, centered around content creator workflows while building upon our existing codebase and maintaining alignment with the comprehensive development plan.
