# Audio Integration: User Journey Mapping

This document outlines the primary user journeys in our application and maps where audio functionality should be integrated within each journey, following our Unicorn UX principles.

## Primary User Journeys

### 1. Content Creation Journey

**User Goal**: Create engaging TikTok templates with perfectly matched audio

**Key Touchpoints**:
- Template selection
- Template editing
- Audio selection and customization
- Preview and refinement
- Publishing/exporting

#### Audio Integration Points:

1. **Template Selection Stage**
   - **Integration Need**: Audio preview for templates in the library
   - **Current Implementation**: Standalone template browser with limited audio preview
   - **Pain Points**: 
     - Audio is not contextually presented during template browsing
     - No indication of which sounds work best with which templates
     - Audio playback stops when navigating between templates

2. **Template Editing Stage**
   - **Integration Need**: Contextual audio selection and editing within the template editor
   - **Current Implementation**: Separate SoundBrowser component opened in modal
   - **Pain Points**:
     - Audio workflow interrupts visual editing flow
     - No synchronized preview of sound with visual elements
     - Sound selection requires context switching

3. **Audio Customization Stage**
   - **Integration Need**: Fine-tuning audio to match visual elements
   - **Current Implementation**: Basic SoundRemixer in isolation
   - **Pain Points**:
     - No visual timeline correlation between audio and visuals
     - Limited editing capabilities exposed in core workflow
     - Premium audio features not progressively disclosed

4. **Preview and Refinement Stage**
   - **Integration Need**: Holistic preview with audio-visual synchronization
   - **Current Implementation**: Separate preview modes for audio and visual
   - **Pain Points**:
     - Preview doesn't accurately reflect final export experience
     - No feedback on audio-visual harmony
     - Can't fine-tune timing directly from preview

### 2. Performance Analysis Journey

**User Goal**: Understand how audio impacts content performance and make data-driven decisions

**Key Touchpoints**:
- Dashboard overview
- Detailed analytics
- Template performance review
- Sound performance analysis
- A/B testing

#### Audio Integration Points:

1. **Dashboard Overview Stage**
   - **Integration Need**: Audio performance metrics at-a-glance

     - No comparative analysis of similar templates with different sounds
     - No recommendations for audio improvements

4. **A/B Testing Stage**
   - **Integration Need**: Testing different sounds with same template
   - **Current Implementation**: Basic A/B testing in isolation
   - **Pain Points**:

- Persistent mini-player allows continued listening while navigating
- Consistent audio controls appear contextually where needed

### 2. Disconnected Analytics

**Current Pain Points:**
- Audio performance data isolated from content performance
- No clear path from insight to action
- Analytics require specialized knowledge to interpret

**Integrated Solution:**
- Unified analytics dashboard with audio as a dimension of content performance
- One-click actions to apply insights to templates
- Natural language insights with specific recommendations

### 3. Limited Sound Discovery

**Current Pain Points:**
- Sound recommendations not contextual to current task
- No indication of which sounds work best with which templates
- Limited browsing tools for sound exploration

**Integrated Solution:**
- Context-aware sound recommendations based on template type, content, and target audience
- Visual indicators showing sound-template compatibility
- Rich filtering and preview tools within main workflows

### 4. Basic Audio Editing

**Current Pain Points:**
- Limited audio customization within main workflows
- Advanced features hidden in separate tools
- No visual alignment between audio and visual elements

**Integrated Solution:**
- Progressive disclosure of audio editing features within main editor
- Visual timeline showing audio waveform aligned with visual elements
- Premium features introduced contextually when relevant

## Next Steps

Based on this user journey mapping, we can now:

1. Design the unified audio context that will maintain state across these journeys
2. Create adaptable audio components that can be embedded within different contexts
3. Implement the integrated interfaces that maintain workflow continuity
4. Ensure all audio touchpoints follow the Unicorn UX principles

Each integration point will need to be carefully designed to maintain the invisible interface principle while providing the necessary functionality at exactly the right moment in the user's journey.

The wireframes provide a starting point for the integrated experiences, showing how audio functionality can be seamlessly incorporated into existing workflows without creating cognitive load or disrupting the user's flow state.
