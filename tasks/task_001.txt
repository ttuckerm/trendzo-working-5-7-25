# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up project structure and core architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project with React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Set up Firebase Firestore integration and establish the basic application architecture.
# Details:
Create a new React project using Create React App with TypeScript template. Configure Tailwind CSS for styling. Set up Firebase project and initialize Firestore database. Create basic folder structure for components, services, hooks, and utilities. Implement basic routing with React Router. Set up authentication flow with Firebase Auth. Create reusable UI components that follow the 'unicorn' UX principles outlined in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds successfully. Confirm Firebase connection works. Test basic routing and authentication flow. Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize React project with TypeScript and configure Tailwind CSS [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new React application using Create React App with TypeScript template and set up Tailwind CSS for styling
### Details:
Run 'npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript' to create the project. Install Tailwind CSS by running 'npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer'. Initialize Tailwind with 'npx tailwindcss init -p'. Configure the tailwind.config.js file to include the paths to all of your template files. Add the Tailwind directives to your ./src/index.css file. Create a basic theme configuration that aligns with the 'unicorn' UX principles.

## 2. Set up project folder structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Establish a scalable folder structure for components, services, hooks, and utilities
### Details:
Create the following directory structure: src/components (for UI components), src/components/ui (for reusable UI elements), src/services (for API and Firebase interactions), src/hooks (for custom React hooks), src/utils (for utility functions), src/pages (for page components), src/types (for TypeScript interfaces and types), and src/context (for React context providers). Add appropriate README.md files in each directory explaining its purpose and usage patterns.

## 3. Set up Firebase project and Firestore integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create a Firebase project, initialize Firestore database, and set up the connection in the React application
### Details:
Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console. Enable Firestore database and set up initial security rules. Install Firebase SDK with 'npm install firebase'. Create a src/firebase/config.ts file to initialize Firebase with your project configuration. Create a src/services/firebase.ts file with helper functions for Firestore operations (create, read, update, delete). Implement proper error handling and type safety for all Firebase interactions.

## 4. Implement Firebase authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Set up authentication flow with Firebase Auth including sign-up, sign-in, and user session management
### Details:
Enable authentication methods in Firebase console (email/password, Google, etc.). Create src/services/auth.ts with functions for user registration, login, logout, and password reset. Implement a useAuth custom hook in src/hooks/useAuth.ts to manage authentication state. Create an AuthContext in src/context/AuthContext.tsx to provide authentication state throughout the app. Add protected routes functionality to restrict access to authenticated users only.

## 5. Set up routing with React Router [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.4
### Description: Implement application routing structure using React Router
### Details:
Install React Router with 'npm install react-router-dom'. Create a src/routes/index.tsx file defining the application's route structure. Implement public routes (login, register, landing page) and protected routes (dashboard, profile, etc.). Create a RouteGuard component to handle authentication-based route protection. Set up lazy loading for route components to improve initial load performance.

## 6. Create core reusable UI components [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.5
### Description: Develop a set of reusable UI components following the 'unicorn' UX principles
### Details:
Create the following components in src/components/ui: Button (with variants: primary, secondary, danger), Input (with validation states), Card, Modal, Alert, Dropdown, and Navigation. Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS. Ensure all components are fully typed with TypeScript. Add accessibility attributes (aria-* attributes, proper roles, keyboard navigation). Create a simple Storybook setup or component documentation to showcase the components and their variants.
