# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Analytics Dashboard for premium users
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the analytics dashboard with template performance metrics, engagement comparison tools, and data visualization.
# Details:
Design analytics data model for storing template performance metrics. Create visually appealing dashboard with key metrics overview. Implement engagement comparison tools between templates. Add time-based filtering options for historical data. Build category performance insights visualization. Create user content tracking metrics. Implement export capabilities for reporting. Ensure the dashboard is only accessible to premium and business tier users. Design with 'invisible interface' principles for instantly comprehensible data visualization.

# Test Strategy:
Test dashboard loading performance with large datasets. Verify metrics calculations are accurate. Ensure time-based filtering works correctly. Test export functionality for different report formats. Verify tier-based access control prevents free users from accessing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement analytics data model [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the database schema and data models to store template performance metrics and user engagement data
### Details:
Design database tables/collections for: template usage statistics, user engagement metrics, template performance over time, and category performance data. Include fields for timestamps, user tiers, template IDs, view counts, completion rates, and engagement duration. Implement data aggregation methods and ensure proper indexing for efficient querying. Create the data access layer with appropriate methods for retrieving and filtering analytics data.

## 2. Implement premium user access control for analytics [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create authentication middleware to restrict dashboard access to premium and business tier users only
### Details:
Extend the existing authentication system to verify user subscription tier before granting access to analytics endpoints. Implement route guards for frontend dashboard components. Create API middleware that validates premium/business status before serving analytics data. Add redirects for non-premium users with appropriate messaging about upgrading. Test access control with users from different subscription tiers.

## 3. Build core dashboard layout with key metrics overview [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Develop the main dashboard UI with key performance indicators and metrics summary
### Details:
Create a responsive dashboard layout following 'invisible interface' principles for intuitive data comprehension. Implement key metrics cards showing template usage, engagement rates, and performance trends. Design with clear visual hierarchy and minimal cognitive load. Include summary statistics section with top-performing templates. Use appropriate data visualization components (charts, graphs) for metrics overview. Ensure the UI adapts to different screen sizes.

## 4. Implement template comparison and category performance tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Create interactive visualization components for comparing template performance and analyzing category insights
### Details:
Develop side-by-side comparison tools for analyzing multiple templates' performance metrics. Implement category performance visualization with filtering by time period and category type. Create interactive charts showing relative performance across templates. Add tooltips with detailed metrics on hover. Ensure visualizations follow data visualization best practices with appropriate chart types for different comparison scenarios. Include trend indicators for performance changes over time.

## 5. Add time-based filtering and historical data visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Implement date range selectors and historical data views for longitudinal analysis
### Details:
Create date range picker components with preset options (last week, month, quarter, year) and custom range selection. Implement time-series visualizations showing performance trends over selected periods. Add comparison functionality between time periods (e.g., this month vs. previous month). Ensure efficient data loading with appropriate caching for historical queries. Implement UI indicators for data loading states and empty data scenarios.

## 6. Implement user content tracking and export capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Add detailed user engagement metrics and data export functionality for reporting
### Details:
Create detailed user content engagement tracking visualizations showing how users interact with templates. Implement export functionality supporting CSV, PDF, and image formats for reports and visualizations. Add scheduled report generation and email delivery options. Include annotation capabilities for dashboards. Ensure exported data maintains proper formatting and includes relevant metadata. Add data table views for raw metrics access. Perform final testing across all dashboard components and optimize performance.
