# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement basic template editor UI framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational UI structure for the template editor with step-by-step sections and navigation
### Details:
Implement a responsive layout with sections for media preview, timeline, and toolbars. Design the step-by-step workflow UI with clear navigation between template sections. Include placeholder areas for tools that will be implemented in later subtasks. Use a component-based architecture to allow for easy extension as more features are added. The UI should follow TikTok's design language for familiarity.

## 2. Implement text overlay editor with styling options [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create text editing functionality with font, color, size, and positioning controls
### Details:
Build a text editor component that allows adding, editing, and removing text overlays. Implement controls for font selection (with TikTok-like options), color picker with preset palettes, size adjustment, and text effects. Add drag-and-drop positioning and rotation capabilities. Include text alignment tools and basic animations. Ensure text remains editable after placement and implement undo/redo functionality for text changes.

## 3. Develop timeline and timing adjustment functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a timeline interface with the ability to adjust section timing and transitions
### Details:
Build a visual timeline component showing template sections and their durations. Implement drag handles for adjusting section lengths and transition points. Add functionality to preview timing changes in real-time. Include options for setting specific durations in seconds. Create visual indicators for section boundaries and transitions. Ensure the timeline synchronizes with the preview area to reflect current playback position.

## 4. Build media replacement and customization tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.3
### Description: Implement functionality for users to replace template media with their own content
### Details:
Create media placeholders in the template that clearly indicate where users can add their content. Implement media upload functionality supporting images and videos. Add basic media editing tools including crop, resize, and position adjustment. Ensure uploaded media automatically fits the template format while maintaining aspect ratios. Include validation to ensure media meets TikTok's requirements for resolution and duration.

## 5. Create contextual toolbars and template structure guide [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4
### Description: Implement smart toolbars that appear when needed and visual cues for template structure
### Details:
Design and implement contextual toolbars that appear when specific elements are selected (text, media, transitions). Create visual guides and cues that help users understand the template structure and how to customize each section. Add tooltips and helper text for first-time users. Implement a template structure sidebar that shows all sections and allows quick navigation. Ensure the UI remains clean by only showing relevant tools at appropriate times.

## 6. Implement preview and playback functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Create real-time preview capabilities with playback controls for the template
### Details:
Build a preview component that renders the template with all customizations in real-time. Implement standard playback controls (play, pause, seek). Add functionality to preview specific sections or the entire template. Ensure the preview accurately represents how the final export will appear on TikTok. Implement efficient rendering to maintain smooth playback even with complex templates. Add options to preview at different device dimensions.

## 7. Develop export functionality in TikTok-compatible format [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6
### Description: Create the ability to export the customized template as a video ready for TikTok
### Details:
Implement server-side rendering to combine all template elements (video, images, text overlays) into a final video. Ensure the export process maintains timing, transitions, and effects as shown in the preview. Create a progress indicator for the export process. Add options for different quality levels and aspect ratios. Implement proper error handling for failed exports. Ensure the final output meets TikTok's technical specifications for optimal upload quality. Add functionality to download the exported video or directly share to TikTok if API integration is available.
