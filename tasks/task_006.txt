# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Template Remix engine for premium users
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the Template Remix engine with AI-powered customization that preserves viral elements while allowing personalization.
# Details:
Integrate Claude API for template analysis and customization suggestions. Create template variation suggestion system based on user preferences. Implement performance prediction for customizations. Build sound pairing recommendations feature. Design interface for template remixing that guides users through the process. Implement brand kit integration for premium users. Ensure the remix engine preserves key viral elements of templates. Create a system to track and learn from successful remixes.

# Test Strategy:
Test Claude API integration for reliability. Verify template variation suggestions are relevant. Test performance prediction accuracy against actual results. Ensure sound pairing recommendations are appropriate for template types. Test brand kit integration with various brand assets.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Claude API integration for template analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the integration with Claude API to analyze templates and identify their key viral elements and customizable components.
### Details:
Create a service layer that communicates with Claude API. Develop functions to send template data to Claude and process responses. Implement template parsing to extract structure, elements, and relationships. Build a caching mechanism to store analysis results. Create a data model to represent template components and their viral importance scores.

## 2. Build template variation suggestion system [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop an algorithm that generates customization suggestions based on user preferences while preserving viral elements identified by Claude.
### Details:
Create a recommendation engine that uses Claude's analysis to suggest safe modifications. Implement user preference analysis based on past behavior and explicit settings. Design algorithms to generate variations that respect viral elements' integrity. Build a scoring system to rank suggestions by predicted effectiveness. Develop a database schema to store suggestion templates and their relationships to original templates.

## 3. Implement performance prediction for customizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Create a system that predicts how template modifications will affect performance based on historical data and Claude's analysis.
### Details:
Develop a machine learning model to predict performance metrics based on template features. Implement A/B testing framework to validate predictions. Create visualization components to show predicted performance changes. Build a feedback loop system that improves predictions based on actual performance data. Design an API for the frontend to query performance predictions for specific modifications.

## 4. Develop sound pairing recommendations feature [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.3
### Description: Build a system that suggests optimal sound pairings for remixed templates based on content analysis and performance data.
### Details:
Integrate with sound library API to access available sounds. Create content analysis algorithms to match template themes with appropriate sounds. Implement collaborative filtering to suggest sounds based on similar successful templates. Build a testing framework to evaluate sound pairing effectiveness. Design a caching system for quick sound recommendations retrieval.

## 5. Design and implement template remixing user interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Create an intuitive, guided interface for premium users to remix templates with clear visualization of viral elements and customization options.
### Details:
Design wireframes and mockups for the remix interface. Implement a step-by-step guided workflow with progress indicators. Create interactive components for template element selection and modification. Build visual indicators for viral elements that should be preserved. Implement real-time preview of changes with performance prediction indicators. Develop undo/redo functionality and version history.

## 6. Implement brand kit integration for premium users [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.5
### Description: Enable premium users to apply their brand assets (colors, fonts, logos) to templates during the remix process while maintaining template effectiveness.
### Details:
Create a brand kit management interface for users to upload and organize assets. Implement algorithms to intelligently apply brand colors while preserving visual harmony. Develop font substitution that maintains readability and style. Build logo placement suggestions based on template composition. Create a preview system to compare original vs. branded versions. Implement brand asset validation to ensure quality and compatibility.

## 7. Build remix tracking and learning system [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.5, 6.6
### Description: Develop a system to track performance of remixed templates and feed this data back into the suggestion and prediction engines.
### Details:
Create analytics tracking for remixed template performance metrics. Implement a database schema to store relationships between original templates and remixes. Build a feedback loop that improves suggestion algorithms based on successful remixes. Develop dashboards for internal teams to monitor remix performance trends. Create an automated system to identify high-performing remixes for featuring. Implement A/B testing framework to continuously improve the remix engine.
