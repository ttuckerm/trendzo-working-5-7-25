# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Trend Prediction system for business tier
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Create the AI-powered trend prediction system that identifies emerging templates 3-5 days before mainstream adoption.
# Details:
Integrate Apify TikTok scraper for video metadata collection. Implement template pattern recognition algorithms. Create confidence scoring system for predictions. Build categorization by content type and audience. Implement notification system for new trends. Design trend velocity metrics visualization. Create industry-specific trend filtering. Build expert adjustment capability for human oversight. Implement prediction accuracy tracking over time. Ensure the system is only accessible to business tier users.

# Test Strategy:
Test Apify integration for reliable data collection. Verify pattern recognition algorithms identify valid templates. Test notification system delivery. Ensure confidence scoring correlates with actual trend adoption. Verify tier-based access control limits to business users only.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement TikTok data collection pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the data collection infrastructure using Apify TikTok scraper to gather video metadata at scale
### Details:
Integrate the Apify TikTok scraper API to collect video metadata including views, likes, shares, comments, hashtags, audio tracks, and posting timestamps. Implement a scheduled collection system that runs every 4-6 hours to gather fresh data. Create a data storage solution that efficiently indexes content by relevant attributes. Implement data cleaning and normalization procedures to handle inconsistencies in the raw data. Add authentication to ensure only business tier users can access this functionality.

## 2. Develop template pattern recognition algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create algorithms that can identify emerging templates and patterns from the collected TikTok data
### Details:
Implement clustering algorithms to group similar content based on audio, visual elements, hashtags, and caption patterns. Develop time-series analysis to track growth rates of specific patterns. Create feature extraction methods to identify key elements that constitute a 'template' (audio, transitions, formats, etc.). Use machine learning models (gradient boosting or neural networks) to classify content into template categories. Implement anomaly detection to identify unusual growth patterns that may indicate emerging trends.

## 3. Build trend confidence scoring system [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create a scoring mechanism that evaluates potential trends and assigns confidence levels to predictions
### Details:
Develop a multi-factor scoring algorithm that considers growth velocity, creator diversity, audience engagement metrics, and historical pattern similarity. Implement Bayesian probability models to calculate the likelihood of mainstream adoption. Create threshold definitions for different confidence levels (e.g., possible, likely, highly probable trends). Design a calibration system that adjusts scoring based on historical accuracy. Implement a database schema to track predictions and their confidence scores over time.

## 4. Implement content categorization and filtering system [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Create a system to categorize trends by content type, audience demographics, and industry relevance
### Details:
Develop classification models to categorize content into types (e.g., dance, comedy, tutorial, etc.). Implement audience demographic analysis based on engagement patterns and creator profiles. Create industry-specific filters that match trends to relevant business sectors. Build a tagging system for trends that allows for multiple categorizations. Implement a search and filter interface for business users to find relevant trends for their specific needs.

## 5. Develop trend notification and visualization system [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Create interfaces to notify users of new trends and visualize trend velocity metrics
### Details:
Implement a notification system that alerts business users when new high-confidence trends are detected. Create interactive dashboards showing trend velocity, growth curves, and prediction confidence. Develop visualizations that compare current trends to historical patterns. Build timeline views showing the predicted lifecycle of trends. Implement export functionality for reports and data. Ensure all visualizations are responsive and accessible through the business tier interface.

## 6. Implement human oversight and expert adjustment capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.5
### Description: Create tools for human experts to review, adjust, and override algorithmic predictions
### Details:
Build an administrative interface for trend analysts to review algorithmic predictions. Implement adjustment controls that allow experts to modify confidence scores and categorizations. Create an annotation system for adding qualitative insights to trend data. Develop an approval workflow for publishing high-confidence trends to business users. Implement logging of all human adjustments to use as feedback for improving the algorithms.

## 7. Build prediction accuracy tracking and system optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.6
### Description: Develop mechanisms to track prediction accuracy over time and continuously improve the system
### Details:
Implement metrics to compare predicted trends against actual mainstream adoption. Create a feedback loop that uses accuracy data to tune the prediction algorithms. Develop A/B testing capabilities to evaluate algorithm improvements. Build performance monitoring for system resource usage and optimization. Create a regular retraining schedule for machine learning models based on new data. Implement comprehensive logging and error handling throughout the system.
