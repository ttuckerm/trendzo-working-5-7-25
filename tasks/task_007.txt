## 2. Develop unique template link generation system [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a system that generates unique, trackable links for templates shared in newsletters
### Details:
Implement a link generation service that creates unique identifiers for each template and newsletter campaign. Each link should contain encoded information about the template ID, campaign ID, and recipient (when possible). Use a URL shortener approach for cleaner links in emails. Ensure links are cryptographically secure to prevent tampering. Create database tables to store link metadata for later analytics processing. Include functionality to expire links after a certain period if needed.

## 3. Build authentication handling with template context preservation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Implement authentication flow that maintains template context when users click newsletter links
### Details:
Create middleware that extracts template context from incoming links. For unauthenticated users, store the context in a secure session or cookie before redirecting to login/signup. After authentication completes, retrieve the stored context and redirect to the appropriate template. For authenticated users, directly process the template context. Implement security measures to prevent context spoofing or injection attacks. Test thoroughly with various authentication states and link formats.

## 4. Implement template preloading and one-click sound selection [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Create functionality to preload templates in the editor based on newsletter links and enable one-click sound selection
### Details:
Extend the editor to accept template parameters from URL query strings. Implement a preloading mechanism that fetches template data and populates the editor accordingly. Create a streamlined sound selection interface that allows users to immediately apply sounds featured in newsletters with a single click. Ensure proper error handling for invalid templates or sounds. Add loading indicators during the preloading process. Test across different browsers and devices to ensure consistent behavior.

## 5. Develop analytics tracking system for newsletter performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Create a comprehensive analytics system to track newsletter performance and user journey conversion
### Details:
Implement event tracking for all newsletter link interactions including opens, clicks, template views, and conversions. Create dashboard visualizations showing key metrics like click-through rates, conversion rates, and engagement by campaign. Build user journey funnels to analyze the path from newsletter to platform usage. Implement A/B testing capabilities for different newsletter templates or calls-to-action. Create automated reports that can be scheduled and emailed to administrators. Ensure all tracking is privacy-compliant with options for users to opt out.
