# The Viral Content Framework

After analyzing all the documents, I've identified a comprehensive viral content framework along with examples for each component. This framework represents the patterns consistently demonstrated across successful viral content.

## Core Framework Structure

The viral content follows this general structure:

1. **Hook** (first 3 seconds)
   - Verbal hook (what you say)
   - Visual hook (what is seen)
   - Text hook (what appears on screen)

2. **Authority Gap** (establishes credibility immediately after hook)

3. **Value Content** (the main substance of the video)
   - Following specific formats
   - Using engaging filming techniques
   - Delivering on the hook's promise

4. **Call to Action (CTA)** (end of video)

## 1. HOOKS

Hooks are critical - they determine in the first 3 seconds whether viewers will continue watching.

### A. Authority Hooks

"Not to flex, but I'm pretty fucking good at social media marketing."

"Everybody is complimenting on my figure because of one workout routine that I do."

"These seven habits dramatically transformed my physique in just 30 days."

"To become rich, you need multiple income streams. I have seven, and they generate me over $100,000 per week."

"I got a 5 on all of my AP exams with minimal studying. And here's how."

"If I ever made it to news, I thought it would be for something illegal. Turns out it's for losing 10 kgs."

### B. Storytelling Hooks

"Yesterday, I was at the park when I noticed something weird, Sour Patch Kids is the most followed candy brand on Instagram".

"A year ago I was sitting at home scrolling when I noticed something strange. Multiple creators were going viral with the same hook."

"This is a picture of my first date ever with this guy named Ben."

"Six months into my home renovation, my worst nightmare became my reality."

"It all started when this girl broke my heart."

"One year ago today, I stopped shooting NFL games, started working with the best athletes in sports."

"Six months ago, my wife and I dropped out of school, got married, and decided to chase our dreams of traveling the world together."

"Five years ago, I got dumped by my girlfriend because I was playing league of legends instead of getting her flowers."

"I got engaged when I was 16."

"Five years ago, my teacher told me I'd never get into an Ivy League."

"I've read over 350 books in my life."

"Here's how I went from taking pictures at my high school to working for my dream college football team."

"As you might know, I started my pajama business when I was 19 with $800."

"All of these viral videos have the same exact hook six months in. A year ago. Six months ago. One year ago. Six years ago."

### C. Education/Tutorial Hooks

"It took me 10 years to learn this but I'll teach it to you in less than one minute".

"If I woke up 30 pounds overweight tomorrow and want to lose it all by summer, here's exactly what I do."

### D. Shock Value Hooks

"i'm so sorry but no amount of money could make hang out with an ugly dude"

"if you're an adult and you're still eating like a child grow the **** up"

"90% of you are either going to hate or dislike or not care about what I'm going to say next"

"I'm gonna tell you how you can get drunk in under 600 calories this summer".

"This is why you should always wash your bread before eating it."

### E. Myth-Busting Hooks

"Just because you've never cheated before doesn't make you a loyal person."

### F. Comparison Hooks

"100 view hook '3 foods to never give your dog' versus a million view Hook, 'Morgan, what's one thing that's toxic to dogs?'."

"100 view hook 'this is why I love my value eating hacks so, so much' versus a million view hook, 'For this croissant You can have all these raspberries with this much whipped cream!'."

"100 view hook 'do you wanna bring your A game to your next job interview?', Versus a million view hook, 'You asked for it! Here are five things that you can and should lie about in the interview process'."

"100 view hook 'here's some tips! Tips to grow a stronger bond and healthier relationship with your partner', versus a million view hook. 'The sad truth is that love will never be enough to save your relationship'."

"100 views hook versus 1 million views hook. 'Here are the top three marketing books that you need to read'. 'Here are three marketing books that will teach you more than having a marketing degree'."

"100 views hook versus 1 million views hook, 'Did you know that Band Aids have forever chemicals in them? That can cause cancer?'. 'Cancer warning for you and your children. It is hard to believe, but did you know that Band Aids have forever chemicals in them?'."

"100 views hook versus 1 million views hook, 'Here's how you can start making 10 K per month and I'm gonna explain it to you in under 60 seconds'. 'It took me two years and blood, sweat and tears to realize on how to make my first 10,000 dollar month. And I'm gonna simplify it down to you in just 30 seconds'."

"This cosmic brownie and these three cosmic brownies both have the same amount of calories."

### G. "Is It Possible" Hook Template

"is it possible to get a 6 pack without even going to the gym and only six weeks?"

"Is it possible to get a 14 on the SAT by only?". "Is it possible to love god and quit swearing in 10 days?". "Is it possible for a broke college student to make 100,000?". "Is it possible to pay a college student?".

"All of these viral videos have the same exact hook. Is it possible? Is it possible? Is it possible? Is it possible? Is it possible?"

### H. "This to This" Hook Template

"i took my client from this to this in just 14 days."

"How I got my reels from this to this in 30 days." 

"old algorithm, likes and shares. new algorithms, watch time."

"Viral hook - 'How I got my reels from this... to this... in 63 days'. My hook, 'How I got my reels from this... to this... in 30 days'."

"'Don't start posting on Instagram again until you understand this one thing, that got me from this... to this... in just 14 days'."

"I took my client from this... to this... in 12 weeks. Interested? Follow for more fitness education'."

"I took my client from this to this in 12 weeks. Want the same results? Follow for more fitness education!"

"Old versus new algorithm. This is entertainment content and this is education content. With the old algorithm, both of these did well."

"This is an outlier reel. These are videos that significantly outperform a creator's average. Outliers, from small to midsize creators is one of the best signals a video hook, slash topic has viral potential."

"If your views look like this, and you want them to look like this, then do these three things."

"I went from insert before to insert after. I went from this to this. My glutes went from this to this. How I got my rolls from this to this."

### I. Visual Hooks

"5 visual hooks no one is talking about. Number one, holding up a random ass object to use as a microphone hook, 'Here are the financial moves I'm making now that I turned 18'."

"Number two, the getting ready hook. Grace Beverly does this so damn well while talking strictly about boring business content, and it goes extremely viral."

"Number three, the sitting down and share hook. Five years ago, my teacher told me I'd never get into an Ivy."

"No. 4. Opening up the cabinet, door or fridge hook. 'Speaking to the camera is not a new thing'."

"No. 5, the green screen background, 'Creator founders are the new marketing playbook for 2024'."

"4 visual hooks nobody's talking about. No. 1 the transition hook. Go to transitionalhooks com and find a viral clip. Then film a transition clip of yourself and go into your script."

"No. 2 the Snapchat hook. Have someone film a two second candid clip of you on Snapchat and then add text on the app saying something similar to one of the examples. After that plays, have the video transition into your regular video."

"No.3 fixing tire and wrong name hook. I can't explain it, so just watch. Everybody always asks me Ashley, how do you change a tire? And my response to them is, I don't know. My name is not even Ashley."

"No.4 throwing object at Head Hook. Part one of the hook is an object being thrown at someone's head. Part 2 is right as the person's about to get hit, it will cut to the person and then they'll say something like oh, were you waiting for that to hit me?"

## 2. AUTHORITY GAP

The authority gap establishes credibility right after the hook.

"Zero to 100,000 followers on Instagram with one simple hack. Authority gap. A one liner right after your hook that makes you an authority. For example, a lot of people ask me what's better, stair master or incline walking for fat loss? Pause. That was the hook. I lost 60 pounds doing one of these and it's not even close. That was the authority gap."

"Here's another example. If you're in your 20s, then these are the five things you need to do to make sure you don't end up broke by the time you're 35. That was the hook. This is coming from a 37 year old self made millionaire and former public school teacher. That was the authority gap."

"One more hook. You're probably a girl that wants a flat stomach. Authority gap did not always have a flat stomach. So I'm gonna tell you what I did to flatten it on the screen."

## 3. VALUE CONTENT FORMATS

### A. Video Formats

"multiple formats there are multiple different formats you can use to film a video. their videos often follow a mix of these three formats #1 the shot/angle changes format where every two seconds of the video a new shot/angle is used. number 2 the visual format, where they use a prop to demonstrate niche concept. and #3 the voice over format which is pretty much what I'm doing right now in this moment."

"These video topics specifically seem to work extremely well within this niche, and they received the best results when they were filmed in these formats (the formats were - talking "back and forth" style videos, where the content creators are playing two roles in the video and pretending to talk back and forth with a different person. green screen style videos. casually walking style videos)."

"All the top dogs study their own content and double down on their own best performing video hooks, topics, and especially formats (video formats - visual format, where they stick to a uniform consistent visual appealing format for each video. shot/angle change format. talk back & forth format. clone format)."

"This is a visual format. Also this is a visual format. This is a visual format. And also, this is a visual format. And these are dominating on social media right now. A visual format is when you use a prop or object to demonstrate what you're talking about."

"In fact, this creator just uses this one format, and she has grown 1.5 million followers with only 260 posts. They work so well because visuals keep people psychologically hooked."

### B. Content Types/Structures

"how to turn one crappy video idea into six viral ones. let's say my video topic was 'how to get a 6 pack' there are multiples different ways I could structure this video."

"#1 'tutorial structure', for example "here are five things I did to go from skinny fat to 6 pack in 6 months"."

"#2 'interview structure', "I asked the top five fittest people on the planet how to get a 6 pack and here's what they said"."

"number 3, you get 'challenged structure', "is it possible to get a 6 pack in 60 days? well a month and a half ago I decided to try and here's what happened"."

"#4 'breakdown structure', "here's the fastest most effective way to get abs, according to science."

"#5, 'reaction structure', "today I'm going to be reacting to popular fitness influencers workouts and letting you know if they're effective as someone who went from flabs to fit"."

"#6 'vlog structure', "here is a day in the life where I'm going to show you the lifestyle and habits I did to get a 6 pack"."

### C. Storytelling Frameworks

"storytelling each episode of these creators series almost always uses storytelling to teach in valuable lesson. here are some of my favorite storytelling frameworks (The favorite storytelling frameworks start with number one "Hero's journey" this framework starts with an intro and then there is an inflection point and then there's a rise in action and then there's a climax and then there's a fallen action and then there's a resolution. Framework number two is "before after bridge" - This is just a before and after type video with a bridge in the middle. Framework number three is "the lesson" - This one begins with a setback then pain points then resolution then a lesson. The 4th framework is "the challenge" - the challenge, then the exploration, then the result, then the realization, then the empower the audience)"

"If I had zero followers and I had to get to 10,000 with one video, this is what I would post. It's called a "my story video" and it almost always goes viral. And it follows these six steps."

"Number one, the intro. State the problem you are feeling. For example, 'one year ago, I was trying to lose weight'."

"Number two, the inflection points. State the pain point. For example, 'I was going to my high school reunion in a year where I would have to see my ex, Chad, and I wanted him to see what he broke up with. Freaking loser'."

"No. 3 the rising Action. State the failed solutions. For example, 'but the problem was nothing was working. I tried running and different diets, YouTube workouts, but the scale stayed the same'."

"No. 4 the climax. State the solution that you finally found, aka your product or service. For example, 'I was fed up, so I started to do my own research, created my own workouts and meal plans'."

"No.5 the following action state results from solution. For example, 'because of this, I lost 20 pounds, got my dream six pack, and felt good. When I walked into my high school reunion six months later, Chad invisibly drooled, but I didn't even care about that prick or what he thought anymore'."

"No. 6 the resolution save. The next step slash CTA. For example, 'after this experience, I made it my mission to help women. Just Like me get the same results. I even took my client from this... to this... in 12 weeks. Interested? Follow for more fitness education'."

"The one thing that no one can copy is your personal story. You need to use your story in your content, but that starts with actually knowing your story. So write it out with this story structure."

"No. 1 intros state the problem you are feeling slash experiencing."

"No. 2 inflection point state relatable pain points associated with having that problem."

"No. 3 rising action state the failed solutions you have tried to solve that problem."

"No. 4 climax state the solution that actually helped you solve that problem, aka your product or service."

"No. 5 following action slash resolution state the results slash transformation from the solution and your next steps going forward."

### D. The Loop Principle

"almost every single viral video follows this one principle called "the loop". for example, which of the following hooks would make you watch the video? ' do you want a 6 pack' vs 'is it possible to get a 6 pack without even going to the gym and only six weeks?'. it opens questions in your mind that will keep the viewer engaged until they get the answer at the end of the video. that example was a "challenge loop". but there's also the "dream results loop", ie - 'I got a 5 on all my AP exams with minimal studying and here's how'. the "Journey loop", ie - 'this is how I got to shoot the kid LAROI and the NRL grand final in my 1st year picking up the camera'. or the "Myth busting loop", ie - 'what if I told you that there is a way to run your very own bakery from home without needing a storefront or a big invest'. open a loop in the hook and then give the answer at the end of the video to close it. keep the viewer engaged the entire video."

## 4. CALLS TO ACTION (CTAs)

"Nobody cares about your link in bio anymore. Instead use these called actions that will actually convert. Let's pretend I'm in the fitness niche."

"Level 1 CTA. Follow for more fitness education!"

"Level 2 CTA. Follow for more fitness advice that will make your ex foam at the mouth just by looking at your new hot bod!"

"Are you a busy working mom trying to lose weight but have no time or knowledge? I help people exactly like you lose weight with only 30 minutes of their time a day. Follow to learn how! Level 4 CTA."

"I went from 1 50 pounds to 1 twenty five in 2 months. Want the same results? Well. Follow for more fitness education!"

"Level 5 CTA. I took my client from this to this in 12 weeks. Want the same results? Follow for more fitness education!"

"I'll give you the best hack that I Learned. I'll take it on email. But you can land and expand with the other platforms. Is this. I Learned it from Dean Jackson.

## Content Strategy and Growth Methods

### A. Research Process

"research our professional researchers would do two things first they would find the top 10 people in your industry by searching up your niche clicking accounts and finding and screenshoting the top 10 accounts that pop up. then they would finally top 10 best performing videos that they've ever posted for all those accounts and all them onto a spreadsheet. 2nd they would then write down 5 to 10 niche related keywords search 1 into the search bar switch to the reels tab and find the most viral videos correlating with those keywords on the platform and save them. they would repeat this with all the keywords and that those onto a spreadsheet as well. now we know exactly what goes virally in your niche so we're not throwing spaghetti at the wall."

"stop copying these big creators, instead you should study these small creators that grew up hundreds of thousands of followers in the last year."

"How I got my reels from this to this in 30 days. first come up with 10 to 15 niche related keywords. second go on to tick tock and type in one of your keywords. third look at the "others searched for" section and copy and paste those into a google doc. four, repeat this for all of your keywords. create videos answering these questions and then post. make sure you add these phrases into the captions so you're optimizing for SEO."

"you do not have to post everyday to go viral but if you don't do these 3 tips you probably never will. now these tips are guaranteed to work so make sure you save this video for later so you don't lose it. you just go to the search bar on social media and then type in something your niche for this example i'm going to use 'money facts'. client on the textual 'hamburger' and then hit filter. so what we're going to do is filter for the most viral videos that tick tok is pushing out. so we want to sort by 'like count'. we want to put video category as 'all' and then below there just hit 'last 3 months' or and 'last 6 months'. now tick Tock or any social media platform is going to show you the most viral videos that are underneath the keyword that you want to rank for. this is going to give you the right hashtags and keywords that got them in this place and you can learn the intros and hooks that they use to get all of these views."

"the reason you're stuck under 10k followers isn't because you're not using the right hashtags or because of your video's quality. it's because your scripts suck! so here's how I write my viral scripts. step number one, select the topics. step number two, select a format. for this script i'm going to use the shot/angle change format so every two seconds in the video there's going to be a different shot/angle. step number three, verbal hook. I found this video that has 5X views than the account's following. the hook on this video is "this is not a flex but I'm pretty **** good at photography and videography". i'm going to use this hook as my verbal hook. step number four, written hook. this is what you read on the screen the 1st 3 seconds on the video. this video example also follows the 5X rule and I'm going to be using that hook as my written hook. step number 5, visual hook. what you see for the 1st 3 seconds on the video. for this i'm going to be doing in above shot visual hook."

"step number six, script's value. the scripts value aka the meat of the script, should be written with your own industry knowledge and experience. i'm breaking down the value into actual steps that the viewer can take. step number seven, the CTA. since my goal is to get leads for my business I'm going to take a need CTA for my cta's template sheet and use that. step number eight, filming notes. so for each sentence of the script I write in red text how I want to film it. step number nine, editing notes. in green text I write any special editing notes for the editor and that is how I write viral scripts. in fact that script got me over 7 million views and thousands of leads. now use the steps to write your own viral scripts."

### B. Growth Strategies

"I got my reels from this... to this... Bitch, What? I know you're struggling, so here's your next month of content planned out for you. Okay, I'm ready. You'll have 30 reels total. 20 of these reels will be pure niche related education. Step by step tutorials debunking common myths and mistakes, and industry related tips and hacks to make these get more views. Make them engaging. Look at all these fun elements I have in each one. Check out my profile for Ideas. Genius. But what about the other 10? The next three posts are your pinned reels. Pin No. 1 will be about me, where you talk about all of these factors. Pin No. 2 will be all about your lead magnet slash freebie, where you'll talk about these factors. Pin No. 3 will be about your offer, product, or service, and it will break down these factors."

"Not to sound cocky, but I'm pretty fucking good at social media marketing and there are three different levels of social media growth that all play by different rules. Level No. 1 0 to 1,000 followers. Step No. 1 you need to find outliers. These are videos that significantly overperform a creator's average. Find these in your niche. Step No. 2 study. Add 50 outliers total to a spreadsheet and write out their hooks, topics, formats, and views for each video. Step No. 3 script, film, edit, and post. Script your videos with your own niche, knowledge and experience, but use the viral video hooks and topics in these videos. Then film them all in a bunch of different creative formats. Then finally edit these videos and post about 50 to 100, which should get you to the 5 hundred to 1000 follower Mark. Level No. 2 1,000 to 10,000 followers. Step No. 1 study. Study and find the top five best performing videos that you've posted and study their hooks, topics, and formats. Step No. 2 double down research, script, film, and post videos that double down on your best performing hooks, topics, and formats each month. You're gonna repeat this double down process until you have reached 10,000 followers. Level No. 3 10K to 100K. Keep doubling down on your best performing contents, hooks, topics, and formats. It's gonna start to become super clear on what works and as long as you don't give up you will hit 100 k follow for more no BS Social Media Marketing Education."

"How to create a years worth of content in an hour. First, choose your niche. Some examples could be fitness, sales, real estate, or finance. No. 2. Create 12 sub topics correlating with your niche. For example, if my niche was fitness, here are 12 sub topics I would do. Third Google search type in one of those 12 sub topics into Google. Go down to the section where it says people also ask and where these questions pop up, and you're gonna click these arrows up and down 30 times. This is gonna get you the 30 top most asked questions searched in Google about that sub topic. Take 30 of these and put them into a spreadsheet, and then you're gonna repeat this for all 12 sub topics of yours. Then comes filming, editing, and posting. Film one video under 60 seconds every day answering one of those questions. You can edit that video in the Instagram app and then post that video. You're gonna do this every single day for a year straight and I guarantee you you will grow on social media and become an industry expert."
"This is an outlier reel. These are videos that significantly outperform a creator's average. Outliers, from small to midsize creators is one of the best signals a video hook, slash topic has viral potential. So steal them. I actually practice what I preach, so here's some outlier hooks I've used to go viral. Viral video hook. My hook. How I got my rules from this to this in 30 days. One more viral video hook. This is a picture of my first date ever. My hook. This is a picture of my first date ever with this guy named Ben. Don't throw spaghetti at the wall. Study what works and implement what."
"Here's how to plan one month of content in one hour. Have you noticed series content blowing up on social media? Well, it's helping creators and businesses gain hundreds of thousands of followers, so. Here's how to create your own series. Step No. 1 write down your niche slash topic for the series. Step number two pick a format. The most popular ones are No.. 1 sharing a tip slash lesson every single video. No. 2 completing a challenge where every video is a progress update, and No. 3 creating tutorials around one related topic slash niche. Step No. 3 the rough draft, plan out the number of episodes and the lesson, progress update, or tutorial that you'll share in each video. Step No. 4 create script, film, edit, and post one video at a time."
C. Algorithm Insights
"old vs new algorithm. old algorithm, likes and shares. new algorithms, watch time. aka the total time the average viewer watches through your video. high watch time good, it will get pushed out to more people. low watch time bad, it will stop showing your video to people. your video's hook will change watch time results. for example I posted the same exact video twice but the second time I posted it the results were so much better. let's have both hooks placed side by side. by simply removing the .1 second black screen in the beginning of the video and posting it again a second time they got 5X the views. this wasn't just a 1 off thing. this is also the exact same video but the second time I posted it the results were way better. the only change i made was using different written hook. here's another example where actually the opposite thing happened. the second time I posted it with a new look it actually flopped. the point is a hook change will cause a results change just because a video did bad the first time it doesn't mean it's a bad video."
"Old versus new algorithm. This is entertainment content and this is education content. With the old algorithm, both of these did well. Now this is storytelling content, which is entertainment and education content combined. This is what will do well with the new algorithm. In fact, I studied the fastest growing accounts that blew up hundreds of thousands of followers in the last year and found this is the one type of content that they all posted."
D. SEO & Hashtag Strategy
"here's exactly how I do my SEO to make sure my videos get put on the "for you" page every single time and reach the right people. I personally just use hashtags and SEO that are relevant to my niche but here's a good hack if you have no idea what to put. I'm going to search the topic of your video, for this example I did 'how to make money on tick tock'. you're going to scroll through the videos and you're going to see "others searched for" you're going to take a screenshot of that and then you're going to go into your photos you're going to copy, because you're able to copy words inside of your photos. copy all of that and then when you go to edit your video inside of Tik TOK, you're going to paste all of that in there that is your SEO. that is how tik tok is going to know what this video is about and then you're going to shrink it up and then swipe it off to the side. it's still going to be in your video if you see on the bottom it's still there but it's not on the video it's not visible but it's still helping tick tock know how to categorize your video."
"Are hashtags dead? Yes, if you use it the old way. No. If you're optimizing for SEO, I want you to try to use a 3 by 3 hashtag strategy. Three hashtags go towards the video topic, three are the target audience, and three are the dream result. So if my niche was helping busy business owners get fit, this is what I would do."
E. Niche-Specific Content Strategy
"If I had to grow an account in the finance niche from scratch, this is how I do it. First, I would establish the target audience, branding, and finally, the niche and sub niches that we're gonna post content about. With all this information, I did research to find the best performing content and creators within this niche, see what actually works."
"Here are the three types of content I would have them post. Number one, educational content for their sub niches. These video topics specifically seem to work extremely well within this niche, and they received the best results when they were filmed in these formats (the formats were - talking "back and forth" style videos, where the content creators are playing two roles in the video and pretending to talk back and forth with a different person. green screen style videos. casually walking style videos)."
"No. 2, series content. Here are some of my series ideas. "Is it possible to turn $100 into 10,000 with investing in 30 Days?". "How to retire a millionaire" if you start investing in your 20s or 30s or 40s, 50s, you get the idea. Yeah, "I try to live on $5 a day for a week, and here's what happened". We would take these series and break them down into episodes."
"And No. 3 storytelling content that's vulnerable, raw, authentic, gut wrenching. For example, "how I went from a broke college kid to a millionaire at 30". "How I paid off 100 K in debt in six months". "How this one investing mistake lost me 5 K"..."
The "Double Down" Principle
"This is Noah, and he has dominated creating viral videos because of this one simple trick. After posting a ton of content, Noah finally got his first big viral hit, and he religiously doubled down on that viral. The difference between creators who grow fast versus creators who grow slow is who studies their own results and doubles down on what works."
"One day, I noticed the results on my personal page just kept going down, even though I was putting the most amount of effort into my content than ever before. So I started to study the top creators in different niches and noticed they all did this one thing to grow consistently. All the top dogs study their own content and double down on their own best performing video hooks, topics, and especially formats."
"I decided to put this theory to the test, and here's what happened. First, I found my five best and five worst performing videos from the last six months, added them to a spreadsheet, and studied their hooks, topics, and formats. Second, I scripted videos about the best performing topic, which was investing, and in the best performing format, which is talking back and forth for me. Third, I filmed, edited, and posted the videos, and within a week I got multiple videos over 100 k views, and I gained 6,000 followers. Study your own content."
"These are two people posting the exact same content but getting extremely different results. Bitch what? Bitch yeah, and here's why only one creator is going viral. Number one hook the not viral creator came up with their own hook. The viral creator stole her hook from an outlier video, which is a video that significantly overperforms a creator's average outlier hook. This is not a flex, but I'm pretty fucking good at photography and videography viral creators hook not to flex, but I'm pretty fucking good at social media marketing. No. 2 format. The not viral creator used a boring talking in the camera form. The viral creator used what's called the shot slash angle change format, where every two seconds the shot or angle changes. There are multiple different engaging formats that you can use to film your content. No. 3 CTA. The not viral creator had a follow CTA and the viral creator had a many chat CTA. I'm an SMM for more information. Comments equal engagement, and more engagement lets the algorithm know to push out the video to more people. I lied. This is not two separate creators. This is just my content about the same topic that got extremely different results."
Experience vs. Product Concept
"Miami, Las Vegas is a steakhouse called Poppy Steak. Yes, sir. They sell a 1,000 dollar steak. I asked the guy from Texas, take a look at that picture. How much would you say that steak is worth? Fifty bucks. I'm looking at, it's a thousand dollar steak. But it's not that people want a thousand dollar steak. It's when they bring it out."
"We went to the restaurant cause I got to see what the experience is. Before they brought it out. I told my wife, Ronnie, I tapped her and said, hey, something just changed in here. And what it was, the atmosphere shifted. It shifted because the music changed and the DJ had changed the music up. And I saw the waiters. The wait staff was like bunched up back in the corner, huh? And they were coming out with like, which look like a briefcase. Now, this briefcase is what they call a beef case. And when they bring it out to your table, they open it up, it has a huge raw Tomahawk steak on it sitting on like a bed of what looks like that. They're not diamonds. They look like diamonds. Everybody is cheering. Everybody is chanting. They got the box closed. They open it up. They like, let's go, go, go, go. Ah. Then they close it back, open it up again. So it's all the same again. They sell this six for $1,000."
"The owner posted that when the Super Bowl weekend. Right. The Super Bowls in town, they sold over 200 of those steaks at $1,000 each. Yes. Now, again, I can guarantee you there's someone here that makes a better steak for sure. It's not about who has the best steak. It's about who has the best experience."
Three Tips to Triple Virality
"This year, I finally cracked the algorithm. Here's how to triple your chances of going viral. Stop only using one hook and instead use three. Ava. But how? Let me show you. There are three kinds of hooks."
"Number one, the verbal hook. This is what you say during the first three seconds of a video. For example. After watching hundred and ninety eight videos on how to make money online, these are the two best videos."
"Number two, the Visual Hook. What you see during the first three seconds of the video. Check this out. For this slice of restaurant pizza, you could have this whole in entire pepperoni pizza."
"And No. 3, the text hook. What you read during the first three seconds of the video. For example. By far the easiest way as an entrepreneur to consistently have content to post and make."
"But the most powerful hooks combined. All three."
Branding Impact
"I will show you the power of good branding design. Let's play a game. Which of these two coffees feels stronger? Did you choose this one? Which drink feels more healthy? Yep. Which law firm feels more bold and premium? If you guessed that one, you are correct. That's because we created that emotion."
"Good, strategic branding sparks certain emotions and feelings within your customers that makes them choose you over your competition. Everything from the logo to the color palette to the font and the messaging are all working together cohesively to share a unique message and feeling."
"We didn't start with the design. We started with the strategy. We understood the service that the client wanted to sell. We then positioned it to attract a certain target audience, then connected them with a unique story that lastly, emotes a unique brand personality. And that's what makes your brand."
