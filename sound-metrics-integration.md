# Sound Metrics Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the integration of sound metrics into the Performance Analytics dashboard. Sound metrics provide valuable insights into how audio affects template engagement and performance.

## Navigation Path

The sound metrics are now integrated into the main Performance Analytics page:

```
Dashboard → Analytics → Performance Metrics → Sound Impact tab
```

## Features Implemented

### 1. Sound Impact Tab

A new "Sound Impact" tab has been added to the Performance Analytics dashboard at `/dashboard-view/analytics/performance`. This tab includes:

- Sound usage metrics
- Sound engagement metrics
- Sound category distribution
- Sound growth trends
- Sound-template correlations

### 2. Integration Points

The sound metrics integration connects with:

- Sound API endpoints (`/api/sounds/...`)
- Template correlation data
- Sound growth analytics

### 3. Components Used

The integration leverages existing components:

- `SoundTemplateCorrelation`: Visualizes how sounds correlate with templates
- `SoundGrowthChart`: Displays sound usage growth over time

### 4. Navigation Updates

- Fixed "Performance Metrics" button in the sidebar to point to `/dashboard-view/analytics/performance`
- Added redirect from old path `/analytics/performance` to maintain link integrity

## Technical Implementation

1. **Sidebar Navigation**: Updated in `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
2. **Performance Page**: Enhanced in `src/app/dashboard-view/analytics/performance/page.tsx`
3. **Redirect Implementation**: Added in `src/app/analytics/performance/page.tsx`

## Data Flow

1. Sound metrics are loaded from backend APIs
2. Data is processed and displayed in appropriate visualizations
3. User interactions (time period changes, category filters) trigger data updates

## Usage

Users can access sound metrics by:

1. Clicking on "Performance Metrics" in the Analytics section of the sidebar
2. Selecting the "Sound Impact" tab on the Performance Analytics page

## Testing

A comprehensive test checklist is available in `sound-features-test-checklist.md` to verify all aspects of the sound metrics integration.
