# Template Editor Integration

This document outlines the integration of the Template Editor into the Dashboard View to create a unified product experience.

## Overview

Previously, the Template Editor was a standalone page (/editor) that existed outside the main dashboard application layout. This caused a disjointed user experience when navigating between the dashboard and the editor.

The integration now embeds the Template Editor directly into the dashboard view, maintaining the navigation sidebar, header, and all other dashboard UI elements.

## Implementation Details

The implementation involved several changes:

1. **New Dashboard-Integrated Editor Page:**
   - Created a new page at `/dashboard-view/template-editor` 
   - This page uses the existing dashboard layout

2. **Template Editor Component Updates:**
   - Added `isEmbedded`, `returnPath`, and `source` props to the TemplateEditor component
   - When embedded, the editor adjusts its UI (removing duplicate headers/footers)
   - Integrated with dashboard styles and layout

3. **Redirection from Old Routes:**
   - Added middleware to redirect requests from `/editor` to `/dashboard-view/template-editor`
   - Preserved query parameters during redirection
   - Added fallback redirect page at the old location

4. **Context Updates:**
   - Modified TemplateEditorContext to better handle template loading
   - Added support for initialTemplateId to load specific templates
   - Fixed type issues with sound integration

## Files Modified

- `src/app/dashboard-view/template-editor/page.tsx` (New)
- `src/components/templateEditor/TemplateEditor.tsx`
- `src/lib/contexts/TemplateEditorContext.tsx`
- `src/app/editor/page.tsx`
- `src/app/editor/layout.tsx`
- `src/middleware.ts`
- Various navigation components

## Testing

The integration was tested through:

1. Direct URL access to both old and new routes
2. Navigation through UI elements
3. Verifying that template state is preserved
4. Checking that all features work correctly in the embedded version

## Future Improvements

- Further optimize the embedded editor for various screen sizes
- Enhance the collaboration between dashboard data and editor features
- Add tabbed interface for editing multiple templates simultaneously

## Usage

Users can now access the Template Editor in two ways:

1. Through the sidebar navigation by clicking on "Template Editor"
2. By clicking "Edit" on any template in the Template Library

Both methods will open the editor within the dashboard layout, providing a seamless experience.
