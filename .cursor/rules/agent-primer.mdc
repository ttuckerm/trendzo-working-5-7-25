# Cursor Agent Primer

Use this at the beginning of each new Cursor session to ensure the agent understands the project vision and principles.

```
I'm working on the TikTok Template Tracker platform as defined in our PRD. This is a reminder that ALL development must implement the "Unicorn" UX/UI principles defined in our project:

1. Invisible Interface - Technology should disappear from the user experience
2. Emotional Design - Every interaction should evoke positive emotions
3. Contextual Intelligence - Anticipate user needs before they articulate them
4. Progressive Disclosure - Information and functionality revealed progressively
5. Sensory Harmony - Visual elements, motion, and feedback work together

These principles are NOT optional features. They are the core philosophy that must be embedded in EVERY component, function, and interaction we develop.

Please acknowledge that you understand these principles must be applied to ALL work we do today, and indicate how you will incorporate them in any code or components we build.
```

## Strategies for Maintaining Consistency

1. **Begin each session** with the primer above

2. **Reference the unicorn-ux-principles.mdc file explicitly**:
   ```
   Before you write any code, please review our unicorn-ux-principles.mdc file to ensure your implementation follows our core UX philosophy.
   ```

3. **Request principle-specific implementations**:
   ```
   For this component, I need specific implementations of:
   - Invisible Interface: How will controls appear contextually?
   - Emotional Design: What micro-interactions will provide feedback?
   - Contextual Intelligence: How will it adapt to user behavior?
   - Progressive Disclosure: How will complex options be revealed?
   - Sensory Harmony: How will animation and visual feedback work together?
   ```

4. **Ask for explanation of principles in implementations**:
   ```
   Explain how this implementation satisfies each of our five Unicorn UX principles.
   ```

5. **Review code through principle lens**:
   ```
   Let's review this code specifically for how it implements our Unicorn UX principles. What improvements could we make?
   ```

## Reinforcement Techniques

1. **Praise principle alignment**: When the agent correctly implements a principle, specifically praise it: "Excellent implementation of Progressive Disclosure here."

2. **Correct principle misalignment**: When implementation misses a principle: "This implementation is missing our Contextual Intelligence principle. How can we modify it to adapt to user behavior?"

3. **Periodically test understanding**: "Could you explain how our Emotional Design principle should be applied to this analytics dashboard?"

4. **Link PRD requirements to principles**: "According to our PRD section 6.2.2, the Template Editor requires specific Invisible Interface elements. How are we implementing those?"

Remember that consistency in your references to the principles will help train the agent to prioritize them automatically.
