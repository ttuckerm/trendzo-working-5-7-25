# Firebase to Supabase Migration Test Fixes

## Issues Found

1. **Firebase Initialization Error**: The migration test script was failing with "No Firebase App '[DEFAULT]' has been created - call initializeApp() first" because it wasn't initializing Firebase before running tests.

2. **User Duplication Error**: Test users were being created with static email addresses, causing "A user with this email address has already been registered" errors on subsequent test runs.

3. **Schema Mismatch Error**: The code was trying to query a `users` table with an `email` column directly, resulting in "column users.email does not exist" errors.

4. **API Method Unavailability**: The code was assuming `auth.admin.getUserByEmail` method was available, which isn't accessible with the current Supabase setup.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Firebase Initialization Fix
- Added proper Firebase initialization to `test-migration.js` using the existing utility functions:
```javascript
// Initialize Firebase before running tests 
let firebaseSetup = initializeTestFirebase({ debug: true });
    
// If real config fails, use mock config
if (!firebaseSetup.success) {
  console.log('Real Firebase config not found, using mock configuration...');
  firebaseSetup = initializeTestFirebaseWithMockConfig();
}
```

### 2. User Uniqueness Fix
- Updated test user and fallback user generation to use timestamp + random string to ensure uniqueness:
```javascript
const timestamp = Date.now();
const randomString = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 10);
const fallbackUser = {
  uid: `firebase-fallback-user-${timestamp}-${randomString}`,
  email: `fallback-${timestamp}-${randomString}@example.com`,
  emailVerified: true,
  displayName: 'Fallback User',
  photoURL: null
};
```

### 3. Schema Mismatch Fix
- Rewrote the user existence check to avoid direct table queries:
```javascript
// Try to create the user - if it fails with email_exists, the user already exists
const { data, error } = await supabaseAdmin.auth.admin.createUser({
  email: firebaseUser.email,
  // ...other fields
});

if (error) {
  // If the error is that the user already exists, treat as success
  if (error.message.includes('already been registered')) {
    console.log(`User ${firebaseUser.email} already exists in Supabase, skipping.`);
    return {
      success: true,
      email: firebaseUser.email,
      firebaseUid: firebaseUser.uid,
      message: 'User already exists in Supabase'
    };
  }
}
```

### 4. Testing Framework
- Created diagnostic test scripts to verify each component:
  - `test-firebase-init.js`: Tests Firebase initialization
  - `test-supabase-schema.js`: Tests Supabase schema access
  - Updated package.json with test scripts:
    ```json
    "test-firebase-init": "node test-firebase-init.js",
    "test-supabase-schema": "node test-supabase-schema.js",
    "test-migration-fixes": "npm run test-firebase-init && npm run test-supabase-schema && npm run test-migration && npm run test-complete-migration"
    ```

## Test Results
- `test-complete-migration.js` now passes all steps
- Firebase initialization properly falls back to mock implementation when real configuration isn't available
- User creation works without duplication errors through random generation
- Schema validation and correction tests pass

## Next Steps
1. Run the full migration process:
```
npm run complete-migration
```

2. Monitor the process for any additional errors

3. Verify data integrity after migration by comparing Firebase and Supabase data

4. Update application configuration to use Supabase:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_SUPABASE=true
```
